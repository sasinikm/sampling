# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
   *Target population of assignment-2: All current and former entry and lower-level employees who have 
   left this tech company within the past six months.

   Stratified random sampling procedure used for assignment-2
    1.Get a List of all current and former entry and lower-level employees who have left this tech company 
    within the past six months. 
    2.Divide the list based on department, gender and tenure
    3.Decide a sample size 
    4.Based on the sample size allocate weights for the above strata 
    5.According to the weights randomly pick employees from each strata and create a sample population 

   The sample used in this study is representative as stratified random sampling technique is used. But the quality of the sample used in assignment-2 can be improved by adding  Type of position (entry/lower-level) as strata which is one of the main characteristics of the required data. If this strata is missing, the sample we are using is selection bias and it might produce coverage error.
   
   Hence to improve the quality of the sample, Type of position (entry/lower-level) is included and random samples are selected from each strata(Type of position,department,gender and tenure) based on the assigned weights.

 10. What could the company do to improve the employee experience for entry- and lower-level employees?

   Yes I would make changes to the survey questionnaire.
   * Instructions for the survey would be added on top
   * Question to record experience level (Internship/Entry-level/Associate) would be added
   * Question 5 would be changed as it is a double barrel question 
   * For question no. 9 more options would be added

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
   No the purpose of the survey could not be fullfilled by an observational study.
   Some of the data required for the analysis such as employee department,gender,tenure,experience level could be 
   collected from HR records. But data about employee's opinion on job experience, compensation, hybrid work setting,
   company culture and their feedback on how to improve emplyee experience need to be collected via a survey.

	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
