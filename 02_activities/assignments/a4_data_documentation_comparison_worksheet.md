|----------------|:--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample type  |  Stratified sampling |  Stratified sampling  | Convience sampling |
| Sample size  |  40000  | Campaign Period Survey (CPS) - 37822, Post-Election Survey (PES) 10,340   | 112 (73 females, 39 males) |
| Target population | All persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada (excluding full-time residents of institutions)  |         Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older  |Neotropical bat Glossophaga soricina species  |
| Sampling frame  |The frame is a list of records, where each record is a group of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address of Canadian households.|  Canadian citizens or permanent residents aged 18 or older in Ontario, Quebec, West, East and North |  Glossophaga soricina in the Area de Conservaci√≥n de Guanacaste, Costa Rica. |
| Survey mode(s) |    Electronic questionnaire or through CATI  |    Online  |  Individual Glossophaga were caught using mist nets |
| Timeline  | September to December (2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28) |  CPS - September 13th to October 21st 1, 2019  PES -  October 24th to November 11th, 2019  |    7-weeks( late May to early July 2009)|
| Response rate   | 41.9%.| Number of responses were collected from Data Quality section of the given link. CPS : 33905/37822 = 89.6% ,PSE : 9544/10340 = 92% |  Not applicable |
| Weights | The number of persons represented by a given respondent is considered as the weighting factor. Furthermore, in order to adjust for the 'rejecting' of a proportion of respondents that are not volunteers, the person weight for respondents that are not 'rejected' and are not volunteers is multiplied by a factor. Finally, the weights were adjusted so that the weighted income distribution of GVP matched the 2017 CIS distribution by province. |   Weights have been created using an iterative "raking'' process. (using ipfraking in STATA15). Weights considered factors like province, gender, age, and education level. The dataset includes 4 weight variables depending on the respondent group. Residents from territories were excluded due to sparse data for representative sampling.|  The study does not mention the use of statistical weights. |
| Data processing  |  Processing used the SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities to allow subject matter and survey support staff to specify and run the processing of the survey in a timely fashion with high quality outputs.Structured Monitoring: Ensured best practices and consistent business processes through a structured data processing environment. Multi-level Editing: Edits were performed at different stages to address various issues, Family Edits: Verified relationships within data sets. Consistency Edits: Checked data for inconsistencies , Flow Edits: Ensured respondents followed the intended flow of the questionnaire.CATI System: The Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing program played a role in data capture and editing: Limited Response Options: Only allowed valid answer codes for each question, Built-in Edits: Automatically enforced flow of the questionnaire, Real-time Error Detection: Identified issues during the interview for immediate resolution, Interviewer Override: Allowed bypassing edits with forwarding to head office for resolution, with interviewer comments considered, Head Office Editing: Performed all CATI checks in addition to more detailed edits.| PES responses are matched to their CPS responses by using respondent‚Äôs panel IDs. Qualtrics was able to match most of the remaining respondents through other means, and those matches have been incorporated.Some limited demographic information were used to match some additional respondents (IP address, year of birth, and province), but because few demographic variables were repeated across the CPS and PES, those matches were not kept in the data. |    Guano samples were soaked in ethanol and fragmented, insect fragments were removed and stored in ethanol, DNA was extracted using an automated glass fiber technique, DNA sequences were edited, aligned, and visualized, prey surface area was measured from photographs.|
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.  | Imputation was carried out in nine steps. The first step consisted of imputing personal income and family income. The next three steps involved imputing the formal volunteering variables in the master file. Steps five and six were imputing the informal volunteering variables in the master file. Finally, the last three steps involved imputing variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods in the master file.Except in a few cases, all imputations were made using donor records selected through a score function.|  Incomplete responses, duplicate responses of previous respondents, speeders, those who ‚Äústraight-lined‚Äù grid questions and respondents whose postal code didn‚Äôt match their province have all been removed from the data file. CPS: Respondents were categorized based on their most important reason for removal. A response was flagged as a duplicate if they had the same values as another response to the survey for each of the following demographics responses, or had the same panel ID. Of the responses flagged as duplicates, the first response was kept in the dataset while subsequent responses were removed. PES : Duplicate responses were removed using the same procedure as CPS. |   In the absence of an exact match during the comparison of each sequence against the available reference sequences, this study records the percentage of the best match but consider the preliminary hypotheses of identification mentioned in this following "Clare et al. (2011) and Bohmann et al. (2011) for a discussion of sequence identification"  |
| Sources of error| As the data are based on a sample of persons, they are subject to sampling error. Sources of Non-sampling  errors are imperfect coverage, non-response, Response errors and processing errors. |  | Individual variation in insect size. Potential for errors during DNA extraction and sequencing. Relying on reference sequences for prey identification. |
| Limitations, known biases |   Non-response bias  || Potential bias in prey detection due to differential digestion rates of various prey items, which may affect the DNA detectability. Another bias is the geographical limitation of sample collection sites. |
